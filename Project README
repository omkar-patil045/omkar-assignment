Overview
This project consists of a Node.js server and a React client. The server fetches data from multiple endpoints and broadcasts it via WebSocket. The client displays this data in a web interface.
Setup
Server
1.	Navigate to the server directory:
2.	Install dependencies:
npm install
3.	Start the server:
o	Using Node.js:
node dist/server.js
o	Using ts-node (development):
npx ts-node src/server.ts
4.	The server runs on port 3001 and provides WebSocket data.
Client
1.	Navigate to the client directory:
cd client
2.	Install dependencies:
npm install
3.	Start the client:
npm start
This will build and open the client application in your browser.
WebSocket
The client connects to the WebSocket server at ws://localhost:3001. Ensure the server is running before starting the client.
Troubleshooting
•	WebSocket issues: Verify that the server is running and the URL is correct.
•	Data display issues: Check browser console for errors.
